# Mush
The Mushroom User SHell (mush) is a shell that I am writing. It is intended as a part of an Operating System called "Mushroom". It should also run on Linux, but I'll only be testing it on Arch Linux, as that's what I run on my machine.

This is probably the fifth time I've written mush, but I keep on deciding that I can re-write it cleaner.

## Should I Use Mush?
Probably not.

All of Mushroom (including mush) is not really intended to be used, and exists more as a development project for me to stave off boredom.

But if you want to want to run it, don't let that stop you. You just might not get as clean of an experience as you would get with bash or zsh or one of the millions of other shells around.

## How do I Install Mush?
Just clone the repositry, and run "$ make" (compiles mush), then "# make install" (copies the mush binary to /bin/).

To delete mush, type "# make iClean" (deletes mush from /bin/).
