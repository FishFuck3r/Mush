# Mush
The Mushroom User SHell (mush) is a shell that I am writing. It is intended as a part of an Operating System called "Mushroom". It will also run on Arch Linux, as that is what I am writing it (alongside the rust of Mushroom) on.

This is probably the fifth time I've written mush, but I keep on deciding that I can re-write it cleaner.

## Should I Use Mush?
Probably not.

All of Mushroom (including mush) is not really intended to be used, and exists more as a development project for me to stave off boredom.

But if you want to want to run it, don't let that stop you. You just might not get as clean of an experience as you would get with bash or zsh or one of the millions of other shells around.
